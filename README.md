# Project 3: Website Portfolio

Hi everyone! Here is my website, which I have chosen to take the shape of a personal portfolio of my writing, audio work, and visual work:

I don't think this is totally finished yet, as I have so many images in my head for how I want different pages to look — specifically the audio and video pages — but I'm very proud of the work I put into this. I think it very nicely displays my years of writing, and it was super exciting to get to mesh my work in CDM with some of my other journalistic work. Though I'm not pursuing a career in journalism, I find that a lot of the skills are very transferable, and much of what I learned in CDM will help me in a marketing/PR career. Can't wait to link this soon on my linkedin and twitter!
