      <h1>Audio</h1>
      <p>Between my work at WESA and my composing digital media course, I now feel super comfortable in both Adobe Audition and Audacity. More audio coming here soon!</p>

        <h2>90.5 WESA</h2>
          <p>I spent most of my time at 90.5 WESA writing scripts for myself or others to record for air time.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.wesa.fm/post/pennsylvania-uses-charge-drug-delivery-resulting-death-more-any-other-state">Pennsylvania uses the charge of 'drug delivery resulting in death' more than any other state</a></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Several months of data analysis, research and interviewing culminated in one of my best projects about the drug delivery resulting in death charge, which aired on 90.5 WESA.</li>
              </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>In February 2020, I attended an event with one of my favorite Pittsburgh writers, John Edgar Wideman, where he spoke with his brother Robbie about recidivism and the prison system.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>I helped out with WESA's Almanac, which is the station's own "this day in history" kind of thing, and did some research about Three Rivers Stadium.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>I recorded a voicer, a type of radio segment, about Tom Hanks receiving an Oscar nomination last year for his role as Mr. Rogers in "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood." For air, this was read with someone else introducing the story, but I don't have access to that recording at the moment.</li>

        <h2>Composing Digital Media</h2>
          <p> For my sandscape narrative in Composing Digital Media, I interviewed my roommate Jen about her experience preparing to enter the job market post-graduation.</p>
