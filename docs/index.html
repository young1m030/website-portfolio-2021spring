          <p>Hello! My name is Maggie Young, and I'm a senior graduating this May from the University of Pittsburgh with a Bachelor of Arts in English writing. My time spent writing for various publications and organizations has shown me I want to pursue a career in communications and digital marketing. This brought me to a Composing Digital Media course, for which I learned HTML and CSS to design this website!
          This summer, I will expand my writing portfolio as a communications intern with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. I am so excited to start working for such an important pillar of daily life. In the mean time, I've decided to make this website to share my work from class and work I've had published in other outlets, including Pittsburgh Magazine, The Pitt News, 90.5 WESA and Pitt's School of Computing and Information. </p>
