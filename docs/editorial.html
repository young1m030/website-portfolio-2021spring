    <h1>Editorial</h1>

      <p>This is a collection of my best work from Pitt's School of Computing and Information, Pittsburgh Magazine, The Pitt News, and 90.5 WESA<p>

        <div class= 'SCI-header'>
        <h2>SCI</h2>
          <p> As a writing intern for Pitt's School of Computing Information, I've had the awesome opportunity of getting to connect with students, faculty and staff from across the School and learn about all the cool ways my alma mater is changing the world! Here are some of my favorite clips from this experience.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href= "https://www.sci.pitt.edu/academics/student-profiles/pitt2pitt-profile-camilo-correal"> Pitt2Pitt Profile: Camilo Correal</a> </li>
              <ul>
                <li>I spoke with Camilo from his transition from undergrad at Pitt to SCI's Master's of Library Science program with the help of the Pitt2Pitt scholarship. My supervisor shared this story with other marketing departments throughout the University community to use in their Pitt2Pitt campaigns.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href= "https://www.sci.pitt.edu/academics/experiential-learning/benefits-experiential-learning"> The benefits of experiential learning </a></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Alka Singh, SCI's Director of Experiential Learning, told me all about the different service opportunities for SCI students, including the Alternative Spring Break trip and the iServe program. This story comes up on the scrolling display on SCI's home page.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href= "sci.pitt.edu/research/research-spotlight/preserving-shared-digital-memory"> Preserving a shared digital memory </a></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Chelsea Gunn does such fabulous archival research â€” I loved getting to learn all about it.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>The Pitt News</h2>
          <p>Though copy desk will always be my favorite part of TPN, I had so many great opportunities to connect with the University community as a senior staff writer for the culture and news sections.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href= "https://pittnews.com/article/157458/silhouettes-2020/anjana-murali-teaching-to-learn/">Anjana Murali: Teaching to learn</a></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Anjana is one of the most driven and kind-hearted people I've ever met. Read about her work in underserved communities in Pittsburgh.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://pittnews.com/article/156314/featured/students-support-classmates-neighbors-with-mutual-aid/">Students support classmates, neighbors with mutual aid</a></li>
              <ul>
                <li>I was so grateful to utilize TPN's following to spread the word about the mutual aid available to students on behalf of the dedication of their classmates.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://pittnews.com/article/146587/featured/analysis-is-brad-pitt-gearing-up-for-a-presidential-run/">Analysis: Is Brad Pitt gearing up for a presidential run?</a></li>
              <ul>
                <li>April fools! In 2019, our April 1 special edition was The Brad Pitt News, so I took a whack at satire for a change.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>


        <h2>Pittsburgh Magazine</h2>
          <p>For summer 2020, I served as an editorial intern for the Magazine's 412 blog, where I would regularly write short features and news blurbs about various things happening in Pittsburgh.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href= "https://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/the-weather-cant-hurt-this-years-three-rivers-arts-festival/"> The weather can't hurt this year's Three Rivers Arts Festival</a></li>
              <ul>
                <li>I wrote up a preview of the 2020 Three Rivers Arts Festival, which went entirely online.</li>
              </ul>
            <li><a href= "https://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/miss-thrifting-see-how-two-consignment-stores-reopened/"> Miss thrifting? See how two consignment stores reopened</a></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Right as stores started opening up again, I reached out to Avalon Exchange and the Consignment Boutique to see how they pivoted to and from quarantine.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/health-care-employees-get-free-child-care-from-medical-students/"> Health care employees get free child care from medical students</a></li>
              <ul>
                <li>When everything still seemed so uncertain as the pandemic developed, I felt so much joy knowing folks like these students from Pitt Med, who were banding together to provide child care for those on the front lines.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>90.5 WESA</h2>
          <p>I loved learning audio storytelling and Adobe Audition as a newsroom production assistant at Pittsburgh's NPR News station. Be sure to visit my "Audio" page for more clips that went on air!</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href= "https://www.wesa.fm/post/lunar-new-year-celebrations-held-pittsburgh-despite-coronavirus-concerns"> Lunar New Year celebrations held in Pittsburgh, despite coronavirus concerns<a></li>
              <ul>
                <li>After pitching this story, I attended my first Lunar New Year celebration last year in Squirrel Hill and spoke with Marian Lien, president of the Organization of Chinese Americans, for a writeup on a short deadline.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            <li><a href= "https://www.wesa.fm/post/decommissioned-satellites-move-closer-each-other-above-pittsburgh-still-no-collision-expected"> Decomissioned satellites move closer to each other above Pittsburgh, still no collision expected</a></li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Kind of funky, right? The two satellites never collided, but I had a blast writing this, a refreshing reminder to sometimes "just look up."</li>
                <ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
