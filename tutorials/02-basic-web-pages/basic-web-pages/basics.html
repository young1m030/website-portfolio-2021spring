    <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an undordered list:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ol>
  </body>
</html>
    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular phrase,</p>

    <p>Other times, you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
